**Creational design patterns**

Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process.They help make a
system independent of how its objects are created,composed, and represented. A
class creational pattern uses inheritanceto vary the class that's instantiated,
whereas an object creationalpattern will delegate instantiation to another object. (Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software )
